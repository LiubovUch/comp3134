1) Got no results. Query is only looking for users with active, and the Ben user is set as inactive
2) Statement successfully mitigates the SQL injection attack attempt, and the application behaves as expected by returning no results as the user is inactive
3) The input Ben' OR 1=1 is a SQL injection attempt, but the use of prepared statements prevents it from affecting the query. The query looks for Ben with active = 1, but since "Ben" is inactive, no results are shown.
